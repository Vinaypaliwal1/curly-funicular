# Basic Terminology

In modern usage, a definition is something, typically expressed in words, that attaches a meaning to a word or group of words. The word or group of words that is to be defined is called the _definiendum_, and the word, group of words, or action that defines it is called the _definiens_. For example, in the definition **An elephant is a large gray animal native to Asia and Africa**, the word _elephant_ is the definiendum, and everthing after the word **is** is the _definiens_.
