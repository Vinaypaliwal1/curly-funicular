# In Logic and mathematics

In mathematics, definitions are generally not used to describe existing terms, but to describe or characterize a concept. The precise meaning of a term given by a mathematical definition is often different than the English definition of the word used, which can lead to confusion, particularly when the meanings are close.

For example a set is not exactly the same thing in mathematics and in common language. In some case, the word used can be misleading; for example, a real number has nothing more (or less) real than an imaginary number.
